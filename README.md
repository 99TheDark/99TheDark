<h1>Hi, I'm 99TheDark! I've loved coding for over 5 years, so this will be fun!</h1>

:)

Most of my project are hidden or not on GitHub ;)

There are some of my projects (ProcessingJS) ^^^

I have lots of JSFiddles as well, but sadly JSFiddle doesn't have a profile page unless you are logged in as yourself :P

<p>I have a lot of experience in JavaScript, and am pretty good at Java, among many other languages.</p>
